Description:
    Generates (but does not run) a migration to add a source_files table, and a corresponding model,
    as well as a controller, routes, and views for the file uploading.

Example:
    rails generate s3-cors-fileupload:install

    This will create:
        db/migrate/create_source_files.rb
        app/models/source_file.rb
    As well as:
        app/assets/javascripts/s3_uploads.js
        app/controllers/s3_uploads_controller.rb
        app/views/s3_uploads/
        app/views/s3_uploads/_template_download.html.erb
        app/views/s3_uploads/_template_upload.html.erb
        app/views/s3_uploads/_template_uploaded.html.erb
        app/views/s3_uploads/index.html.erb
